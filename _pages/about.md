Due to my interdisciplinary nature of my degree, I gained valuable experience in solar cell and semiconductor technology and characterization techniques, as well as data analysis and interpretation. I had 
  the great opportunity to work on exciting solar cell projects in collaboration with scientists from the University of Hamburg, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology and Deutsche Elektronensynchrotron (DESY).
    

Throughout my academic journey, I have actively immersed myself in various experimental physics projects, displaying a profound fascination for exploring the intricate nature of solar cells and semiconductors 
  through diverse characterization techniques. This relentless pursuit has significantly enriched my comprehension of the subject matter and its practical implications.

As I strive to further refine my expertise in this dynamic field, my attention is captivated by the potential advancements and promising prospects of perovskit solar cells. Their exceptional properties and burgeoning 
  technologies hold tremendous potential in reshaping the renewable energy landscape. I am wholeheartedly enthusiastic about delving deeper into this captivating domain and actively contributing to the ongoing progress 
  and application of perovskit solar cells in real-world scenarios.

In conclusion, my unwavering dedication to experimental physics and my profound passion for solar cell research fuels my ardent aspiration to delve deeper into the realm of perovskit solar cells, thereby paving the way 
  for significant contributions to sustainable energy solutions. Consequently, I am excited to summarize recently published papers in this blog, creating a personal repository of knowledge and insights in this cutting-edge 
  field.
